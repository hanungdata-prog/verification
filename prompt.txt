FIX THIS ERROR USE CONTEXT7.

You are an expert AI DevOps and Python FastAPI engineer. 
Your task is to automatically analyze and fix a FastAPI deployment error on Vercel.
The current Vercel logs show the following recurring error:

TypeError: issubclass() arg 1 must be a class
File "/var/task/vc__handler__python.py", line 242
if not issubclass(base, BaseHTTPRequestHandler):

yaml
Salin kode

---

### ðŸ§© CONTEXT:
The app is deployed at:
https://apinode1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m4n5o6p7q8r9s0t1u2-7gx2dt5eq.vercel.app

Vercel runs this Python app using the internal `vc__handler__python.py`, 
which expects the Python entrypoint file to expose a **FastAPI instance named `app`** â€” not a function, not a module, not a class.

Current error indicates that `base` is not a class, meaning the FastAPI handler was incorrectly declared or exported.

---

### ðŸ§° TECH SPEC:
Your job:
1. Scan and fix all files under `/api/` that are used as Python entrypoints.
2. Ensure that each API route (e.g., `api/index.py`, `api/verify.py`, etc.) exports a **FastAPI instance** correctly:
   ```python
   from fastapi import FastAPI
   app = FastAPI()
Verify all route definitions use the proper decorator syntax:

python
Salin kode
@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"status": "ok"}
Ensure HTML routes (like /verify.html) use:

python
Salin kode
from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse
@app.get("/verify.html", response_class=HTMLResponse)
def verify_page():
    return "<h1>Verification Page</h1>"
Check for any line like app = FastAPI or def app(): and convert them into:

python
Salin kode
app = FastAPI()
Create or fix the vercel.json configuration file as follows:

json
Salin kode
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    { "src": "api/index.py", "use": "@vercel/python" }
  ],
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "api/index.py" }
  ]
}
Move static files like /favicon.ico, /favicon.png, and /verify.html to a /public folder so Vercel serves them directly instead of being routed to Python.

After fixing, print out a short summary of what was changed, including:

Which files were modified

How app was corrected

Whether vercel.json was created or updated

If static routes were moved

ðŸŽ¯ GOAL:
Make the FastAPI app successfully run on Vercel without the issubclass() arg 1 must be a class error.
Ensure visiting / and /verify.html returns valid responses (JSON and HTML respectively).

If you find multiple potential entrypoints, consolidate them so that only one FastAPI instance (app) is deployed as the main handler.

âœ… OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:
Show corrected code files (with before/after diff if possible)

Show updated vercel.json

Summarize what was fixed and why it solves the problem

Do not include unrelated code or extra commentary
